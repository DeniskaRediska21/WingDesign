#     Cm_alpha (Static Pitch Stability): Typical values range from -0.05 to -0.20 per radian. If the value is too large (more negative), the aircraft becomes too stiff and requires excessive control deflection to trim.
#     CL_alpha (Lift-Curve Slope): Generally between 3.5 and 5.0 per radian, depending on the aspect ratio. For highly swept wings, this value is lower than for traditional straight wings.
#     Cm_q (Pitch Damping): Ideally between -5.0 and -15.0 per radian. Tailless aircraft naturally have lower values than tailed ones; a value near -12.0 is often considered a high-end target for natural damping.

# LATERAL-DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES (THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE)
# Flying wings struggle most with yaw stability. Optimal values often rely on high sweep (45 degrees+) or artificial augmentation.

#     Cn_beta (Directional Stability): Target values are usually +0.05 to +0.15 per radian. Values below +0.02 often lead to "yaw wandering." Reference: A Cessna 172 (with a tail) is roughly +0.065 per radian.
#     Cl_beta (Dihedral Effect): Typically -0.05 to -0.15 per radian. In flying wings, wing sweep provides this "effective dihedral." If Cl_beta is too large (more negative) relative to Cn_beta, the aircraft may suffer from severe Dutch Roll oscillations.
#     Cn_r (Yaw Damping): Highly desirable at -0.1 to -0.3 per radian. Because flying wings lack a vertical fin, this derivative is frequently near zero or even slightly positive (unstable), necessitating electronic stability augmentation (SAS).
